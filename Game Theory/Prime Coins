/**
Santa and Banta are playing a game of coins. They have a pile containing N coins. Players take alternate turns, removing some coins from the pile. On each turn, a player can remove either one coin or coins equal to some prime power (i.e. px coins, where p - prime number and x - positive integer). The game ends when the pile becomes empty. The player who can not make a move in his turn loses.
Given the pile size, and assuming Santa always plays the first move, your task is to find out who will win the game, provided that both the players play optimally.
